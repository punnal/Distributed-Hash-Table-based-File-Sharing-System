# Distributed-Hash-Table-based-File-Sharing-System
Application similar to DC++

# Description
We start off with only one node. Whenever another node wants to join the ring, it asks any existing node to find the successor of the hash of the joining node. In case a node wants to leave the chord, it will properly inform its predecessor and successor, and transfer all the files to its successor before going offline. Every node will periodically contact its successor to know if it’s still online, and in case of three non- replies it will assume that it’s no longer online and update its successor. This is achieved by maintaining successor lists(Two successors), rather than a single successor so that the failure of a few nodes is not enough to send the system into disrepair. Client will be able to connect with any node and enquire about a file by its name. The node will compute the key of the file. If the node does not have the file itself it will contact its successor or contacting the node in its finger table that has the largest hash smaller than the key, and forwards the request to it. If a node fails while sending the file, the sucessor of that node will send the file to reciever. For storing, given a file a key is computed based on the file name and the request is either kept locally or is forwarded to the node with the largest hash smaller than the key. The data is replicated at more than one nodes so in case of a node failure the data is still available to users.
